# OpenCloset
OpenCloset is a Ruby on Rails app that helps to organize your wardrobe, share it with other fashionistas, swap clothes or buy/sell them. This app was created as a final project for [Thinknetica](http://www.thinknetica.com/) online school.

## What is OpenCloset
* Private wardrobe to easily search clothes, organize them, combine looks etc;
* Social network for shopaholics and fashionistas, where you can share your looks, comment on others clothes and closets, add favourite clothes to your own closets;
* Swaping platform for sharing clothes with people;
* Ebay where you can sell your clothes or bid on other's clothes even if they are not for sale. Because, who knows, maybe you're gonna make an offer an owner can't refuse.

## Technology used
This project is created on Ruby on Rails.
